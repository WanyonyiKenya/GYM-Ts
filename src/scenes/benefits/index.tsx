                            <p className='my-5'>Exercising regularly, every day if possible, is the single most important thing you can do for your health.
                                In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term,
                                it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers.
                                When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctorâ€”but there are exceptions.
                                If you have a major health condition like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease, osteoprosis or a neurological disease,
                                definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor.
                            </p>

                                What can improve your mood, boost your ability to fend off infection, and lower your risk for heart disease,
                                diabetes, high blood pressure, and colon cancer? The answer is regular exercise. It may seem too good to be true, but it's not.
